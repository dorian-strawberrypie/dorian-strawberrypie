- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dorian CharbulÃ¡k
- ðŸ‘€ In terms of IT Iâ€™m interested in...

&emsp;1. management - the process of leading a team towards a shared goal with acutal results, simply, fascinates and fulfills me.  
&emsp;2. AI - it is a field of business whose opportunities and innovations are far from being drained, there's just so many places it is yet to inhabit!  
&emsp;3. innovation - finding a new use for an older technology & keeping up with new trends and discoveries  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering, AI, C++ (in scope of subjects of FIT CTU), and German
